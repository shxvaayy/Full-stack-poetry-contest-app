🚧 What’s Next?
Let me know:

Should I start creating the HTML wireframes?

Should I draft the documentation file?

Will you handle authentication & backend, or need help integrating?

Once you confirm, I’ll begin delivering in structured parts (starting with the Auth Page HTML and Documentation file).

Let’s build it! 💻📜✨
